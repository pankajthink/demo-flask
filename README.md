## Details about This Toy App

There are three tabs in this toy app

- **Public**: this is a page which can be accessed by anyone, no matter if the user has logged in or not.

- **Private**: Only logged-in user can access this page. Otherwise the user will get a 401 error page.

- **Admin Page**: This part is only open to the user who logged in as "Admin". In this tab, the administrator can manage accounts (list, delete, or add).


A few accounts were set for testing, like ***admin*** (password: admin), ***test*** (password: 123456), etc. You can also delete or add accounts after you log in as ***admin***.
